Work-related anxiety and mental disorders are becoming a common challenge among tech companies. 
According to the International Journal of Social Sciences, software developers have a considerably 
higher chance of experiencing fatigue, burnout, anxiety, and stress, compared to their colleagues 
who perform mechanical tasks. Deteriorating mental health not only threatens the wellbeing of employees, 
but the companies’ overall productivity. Researchers from the Institute of Software Technologies in 
Stuttgart found that mentally-exhausted or depressed developers produce a lower quality of code 
and tend to miss deadlines. Today, tech companies are realizing the importance of mental health 
and taking action to ensure their dedicated development teams stay healthy and sane. - infoq.com (https://www.infoq.com/articles/mental-health-software-teams/)

 The StackOverflow’s 2020 Developer Survey showed that as for mental health and differences IT specialists revealed they lived with the following conditions:

 "an anxiety disorder" – 7.2% of respondents,
 "a mood or emotional disorder (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder)” – 7.2% of respondents,
 "a concentration and/or memory disorder (e.g. ADHD)" – 5.4% of respondents,
 "autism / an autism spectrum disorder" – 2.3% of respondents.
Those numbers seem to be disturbingly high (adding up to as much as 22.1%). It’s worth mentioning, however, that the survey had been conducted in February 2020, 
before the COVID-19 pandemic started to influence people’s lives so greatly. 

Some of the world-renowned companies that do so and implement the policy of putting mental health first are Unilever, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, and EY. They include:

- webinars on topics like How to handle stress and difficult emotions at work, How to stay fit and maintain well-being during quarantine, and Healthy breathing, calm mind,
- psychological consultations with professionals for employees and their families (direct anonymous appointments, scheduled easily by email, held in English or Polish),
- psychiatric and psychological support available via Medicover Premium,
- suggesting additional, external sources of useful information on maintaining mental health and deepening the topic of emotions.
